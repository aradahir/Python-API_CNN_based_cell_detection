# Automatic cell detection interface

A program for counting cells from waveguide cell counter technology. 

# General info

This project is implemented the model from training deep neural network. The model were constructed by using cells derived from cell counter snapshot. Cells were identified by the different reflection of microwave energy.

# Technologies
This project created with:

1. Python version >=3.6
2. Opencv
3. Tensorflow
4. PySimpleGUI

# Run
 ```
Python GUI.py
 ```
