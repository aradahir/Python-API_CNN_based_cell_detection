# Python-API_cell_detection

- This code developed for counting cells that are measured by customized cell counters. 

- I tried to apply a deep neural network for classify and identify cells for counting.

- All codes perform in python using some additional libraries such as openCV.

- Training data was labeled as cells by experts before trained the model.

- This code can be implemented in various application of image processing.

- API was developed under python environment.
